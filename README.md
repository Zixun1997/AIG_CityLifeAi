# how to use the Test Website: 
1. You can access our web application service using our most recent test address: http://www.citylifeai.com:7007
2. We briefly suspend the service on the mobile phone through detecting the page aspect ratio, due to some adaption issues discovered in the phone recently. So, keep the following in mind while launching the service: make sure it's running in **Full Screen** in Chrome on your PC.
3. If you can access the page, but not the internal services, such as registration, login, heat map prediction. Then please contact our backend developer(meðŸ˜€) or our instructor via email: "huangzxarchitecture@zju.edu.cn" or "zhhao@design.upenn.edu".
